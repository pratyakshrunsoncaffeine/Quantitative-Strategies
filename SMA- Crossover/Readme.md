# SMA Crossover Strategy Backtest

This project implements and evaluates a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy using the `backtesting.py` library. The goal is to simulate a trend-following strategy and assess its performance using historical data.

## Strategy Overview

The SMA Crossover Strategy is based on a straightforward rule:

- **Buy Signal:** When the short-term SMA (e.g., 50-day) crosses above the long-term SMA (e.g., 200-day).
- **Sell Signal:** When the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.

This approach captures trend momentum and is commonly used in algorithmic and technical trading systems.

##  Backtest Objective

- Simulate the SMA crossover on a selected stock using historical price data.
- Analyze and visualize:
  - Buy/Sell signals
  - Equity curve
  - Rolling volume bars
- Evaluate performance metrics:
  - Total Return
  - Annualized Arithmetic and Geometric Returns
  - Volatility & Volatility Drag
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Sortino Ratio
  - Maximum and Average Drawdown
  - Win Rate
  - Profit Factor

## Tech Stack

- `Python 3.x`
- `backtesting.py`
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Sample Backtest Results

Below are sample metrics generated by the strategy on one stock over a multi-year period:

| Metric                    | Value        |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Total Return              | 113.72%      |
| Annualized Return (Geo)   | 13.74%       |
| Annualized Return (Arith) | 16.23%       |
| Annualized Volatility     | 18.45%       |
| Sharpe Ratio              | 0.87         |
| Sortino Ratio             | 1.21         |
| Max Drawdown              | -22.65%      |
| Average Drawdown          | -5.83%       |
| Win Rate                  | 46.2%        |
| Profit Factor             | 1.57         |
| Avg Trade Length (Days)   | 38.6         |
